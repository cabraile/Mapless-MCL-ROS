Mapless Monte-Carlo Localization
=============
Tired of having to remap your city streets in 3D for running your autonomous-driving experiments? HD maps are too expensive for your team? This might be a project for you!

This repository contains the implementation of the Mapless Monte-Carlo Localization (or MMCL for short), in which no prior mapping step using an expensive sensor suite is required for localization. In fact, the maps used in this project can be downloaded using the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) database.

For more details on the method, check out our [paper](resources/paper.pdf), which was submitted to the IV2022 conference and still under review process.
